    <title>PSA Doubling Input Template Help</title>

    <h4>Explanation of Input Template</h4>
    Text provided in the Template Input is converted to regular expressions shown at the bottom of the page. Internally
    javascript works on regular expressions but this details is not important to most users.
    <p>Text box is processed to extract PSA value records from each line.
        We look for two values, a NUMBER, which can be an integer (e.g. 4) or
        a floating point value (e.g. 3.5), and a DATE, which is expressed at present in mm/dd/yyyy format where 'mm' is
        one or two digit month (1-12), 'dd' is one or two digit dates (1-31) and 'yyyy' is a 4 digit year. We only
        accept 4 digit year values
        to avoid undesirable inconsistent behavior. See:
        <a target="_blank"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#interpretation_of_two-digit_years">
            two digit year issues.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Any other input on a line other than NUMBER and DATE are ignored. Order matters,
    <p><code><font color=blue>NUMBER</font> <font color=red>DATE</font></code>
    <p>is different than

    <p><code><font color=red>DATE</font> <font color=blue>NUMBER</font></code>

    <p>Input lines contains items of interest in different order in above two cases.
    <p>As values other than NUMBER and
        DATE are not extracted no other text needs to be provided. However, if the line contains multiple entries
        of type
        that we care about, eg the PSA NUMBER, you can
        provide additional text to help disambiguate which NUMBER counts. For example, if line is
    <p>
        <code>  SAMPLE 3.5  LAB-1    2.2   03/05/2021</code>
    <p>
        and PSA value to be used is 2.2 (and not 3.5 which is some other text not relevant to us), then  Input
        template can be simply
    <p>
        <code> LAB NUMBER DATE</code>
    <p>which tells us to extract number that comes *after* text "LAB" in the input line. Thus, the number 3.5 in sample line above, being
        before "LAB" is ignored. (The template, as mentioned, tells us that NUMBER we are looking for comes *after* text "LAB".)
    </p>
    <p>
        In most use cases lines of text
        will
        only consist of a single NUMBER and a single DATE (in either order that should match the Input Template field.) 
        In these cases the Input Template only needs to be either "NUMBER DATE"  or "DATE NUMBER". Extra text 
        is only needed if complex parsing is required as in example line "SAMPLE 3.5  LAB-1    2.2   03/05/2021" 
        shown above.
        Drop down
        choices of Input Template entry provides the standard choices discussed. You can customize as needed, or for expert use you can modify the 
        regular Expression box at the bottom directly. 
        <p>In all cases user should check the "Derived PSA Datatable" and satisfy that correct values are extracted from raw text input before
            hitting "Calc" button to obtain PSA Doubling time.
